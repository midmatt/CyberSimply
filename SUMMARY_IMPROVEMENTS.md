# Article Summary Display Improvements

## Overview
Fixed the article detail screen summary display issues by implementing a comprehensive solution that addresses both the AI summarization quality and the UI/UX for text truncation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ChatGPT Summarization Prompt

**File:** `src/services/aiSummarizationService.ts`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Complete Sentences**: Updated prompts to ensure AI always returns complete, polished sentences
- ✅ **No Ellipses**: Explicitly instructed AI to avoid "..." or abrupt cutoffs
- ✅ **Natural Endings**: Required each section to end with full, natural sentences
- ✅ **Consistent Length**: Set 2-4 concise sentences per section for better readability
- ✅ **Clear Instructions**: Added detailed formatting requirements for both OpenAI and Gemini

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Basic prompt with potential for cutoffs
"Explain what happened in simple, non-technical terms (2-3 sentences)"

// After: Detailed prompt with quality requirements
"Explain what happened in simple, non-technical terms (2-4 concise sentences). 
Write complete, polished sentences that end naturally. Avoid ellipses (...) or abrupt cutoffs."
```

### 2. New ExpandableSummary Component

**File:** `src/components/ExpandableSummary.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Smart Truncation**: Automatically detects if text needs truncation
- ✅ **Smooth Animation**: 300ms animated expand/collapse transitions
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on both small and large screens
- ✅ **Graceful Handling**: No "Read More" button for short text
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: Matches app's design system
- ✅ **Performance Optimized**: Uses native driver for animations

**Key Features:**
- Automatic height calculation
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- No button shown for short text
- Consistent styling with app theme
- Touch-friendly interaction

### 3. Enhanced ArticleDetail Component

**File:** `src/components/ArticleDetail.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Better Summary Display**: Added styled summary container with title
- ✅ **ExpandableSummary Integration**: Replaced old truncation logic
- ✅ **Consistent UI**: All text sections now use ExpandableSummary
- ✅ **Improved Layout**: Better visual hierarchy and spacing
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes

**Visual Improvements:**
- Summary now has a dedicated container with background
- "Summary" title for better context
- All AI sections (What, Impact, Takeaways) are expandable
- "Why This Matters" section is also expandable
- Consistent 2-line truncation for AI sections

### 4. Enhanced NewsCard Component

**File:** `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Consistent Experience**: NewsCard now uses ExpandableSummary
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can expand summaries in list view
- ✅ **Unified Design**: Same expand/collapse behavior across the app

## Technical Implementation

### ExpandableSummary Component Features

```typescript
interface ExpandableSummaryProps {
  text: string;           // Text to display
  maxLines?: number;      // Max lines before truncation (default: 3)
  style?: any;           // Container styling
  textStyle?: any;       // Text styling
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `handleTextLayout`: Measures full text height
- `handleTruncatedLayout`: Measures truncated text height
- `toggleExpansion`: Smoothly animates expand/collapse
- `useEffect`: Automatically determines if truncation is needed

### Animation Implementation

```typescript
// Smooth height animation
const animationValue = new Animated.Value(0);

Animated.timing(animationValue, {
  toValue: isExpanded ? 1 : 0,
  duration: 300,
  useNativeDriver: false,
}).start();

// Height interpolation
height: animationValue.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 1],
  outputRange: [truncatedHeight, textHeight],
})
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

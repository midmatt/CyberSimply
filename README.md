## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CyberSimply
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start                    # Start with LAN (recommended)
   npm run start:tunnel        # Start with tunnel (for remote access)
   npm run start:lan           # Start with LAN only
   npm run start:reset         # Reset and start fresh
   ```

5. **Run on device/simulator**
   - **For Development Build**: Use the Expo Dev Client app
     - Install the development build on your device
     - Run `npm start` and use "Fetch development servers" in the dev client
     - **Never use `http://localhost:8081`** - always use the LAN IP or tunnel URL
   - **For Expo Go**: Scan QR code with Expo Go app (limited functionality)

## Development Client Configuration

This project uses Expo Dev Client for enhanced development capabilities. The configuration ensures proper network connectivity and prevents localhost connection issues.

### Dev Client Scripts
- `npm start` - Start with LAN connection (recommended for local development)
- `npm run start:tunnel` - Start with tunnel (for remote access or when LAN doesn't work)
- `npm run start:lan` - Start with LAN only (no tunnel fallback)
- `npm run start:reset` - Clear Expo cache and start fresh

### Important Notes
- **On device, never use `http://localhost:8081`** - this will not work
- Always use "Fetch development servers" in the dev client after running `npm start`
- Remove any "Recently opened" entries that use localhost URLs
- The app is configured to use LAN IP addresses by default (see `.expo/settings.json`)

### Troubleshooting Dev Client
- If you see "No development servers found", run `npm start` and wait for the server to start
- If LAN doesn't work, try `npm run start:tunnel`
- If you're still having issues, run `npm run start:reset` to clear the cache

## Customization

### Colors
Edit `src/constants/index.ts` to customize the app's color scheme:
```typescript
export const COLORS = {
  primary: '#ff7613',      // Main accent color
  background: '#ffffff',    // App background
  text: '#000000',         // Primary text
  // ... more colors
};
```

### Typography
Modify typography scales in the constants file:
```typescript
export const TYPOGRAPHY = {
  h1: { fontSize: 32, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  h2: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold' },
  // ... more styles
};
```

### Categories
Add or modify categories in the constants file:
```typescript
export const CATEGORIES: Category[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'New Category',
    icon: 'shield',
    color: '#FF6B6B',
    description: 'Category description'
  },
  // ... existing categories
];
```

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create new components in `src/components/`
2. Add new screens in `src/screens/`
3. Update types in `src/types/index.ts`
4. Add new services in `src/services/`
5. Update navigation in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`

### Styling Guidelines
- Use the predefined constants for colors, typography, and spacing
- Follow the established component patterns
- Maintain consistent shadows and border radius
- Use the accent color (#ff7613) sparingly for highlights

### State Management
- Use the AppContext for global state
- Keep component state local when possible
- Follow the established reducer pattern for complex state updates

## Building for Production

1. **Build the app**
   ```bash
   expo build:android  # For Android
   expo build:ios      # For iOS
   ```

2. **Eject from Expo (if needed)**
   ```bash
   expo eject
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Metro bundler issues**
```bash
npm start -- --clear
```

**iOS Simulator not working**
- Make sure Xcode is properly installed
- Check that iOS Simulator is available
- Try resetting the simulator

**Android Emulator issues**
- Ensure Android Studio is properly configured
- Check that an AVD (Android Virtual Device) is created
- Verify ANDROID_HOME environment variable is set

**API key errors**
- Verify all API keys are correctly set in `.env`
- Check API key permissions and quotas
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the project root
